* Using URL Parameters and a Custom Hook

For simpler applications or when the data sharing is not very complex, using URL parameters along with a custom hook can be an efficient solution. This approach avoids additional libraries and keeps the code straightforward.
Why Use It:

    Simplicity: Less boilerplate and no additional dependencies.
    Direct Access: Data can be passed directly through the URL and hooks.

    other options: Context API, Redux (state management library)
